Markdown should be pretty easy. I've done a few go projects and I've honestly loved programming in Go. At present it is one of my favorite languages to program in, for sure. I just wouldn't use it for any low-level languages as it _is_ garbage collected, and wouldn't perform as well as a true low-level language like **C**, **C++**, **Rust** or **Zig**. There was a time when C# was far and away my favorite language but today, to me, it feels like bloatware that is slow but does have very clean and consistent syntax, which makes it easy to develop in, which is why I initially fell in love with it in my teens.

Here is some `inline code` for ya

And a code block, without a language specifier:
```
lda #4
sta $01ff
```

And here's a code block with a "c" language specifier after the triple ticks:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  printf("sup dawggggg\n");
}
```

and here's some ~~strikethru~~ for ya

These lines
 should be rendered
 on the same line
 because there isn't an extra newline
 separating them


Here we go with the tablessss

|Fruit|Cost|Job Word?|
| -- | -- | -- |
|Apple|$1.00|false or "untrue"|
|Banana|$2.00|false or "untrue"|
|Cherry|$0.20|true or "true"|
