# Markdown to HTML converter
Library for converting Markdown to HTML for my web server. I'm aware there are countless libraries out there that do this much better than I can, this is just for fun & practice.

Usage:
```
md2html [-f] <filepath> [[-o] <filepath>]
md2html -s <string> [[-o] <filepath>]
```
